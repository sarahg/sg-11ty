## 🎸 Friendly, casual, normal bio
I'm Sarah, and I live in Northeast Minneapolis. I build things for the web. I have two cats and like to spend my free time playing music, exploring the outdoors, exploring breweries, and reading library books.

## 👩‍💻 Bio for computer dorks
I'm a software engineer with 14 years of experience implementing large-scale web projects, primarily working with open-source CMS platforms. I like developing tools that enable teams to monitor and support the systems they build. I'm pretty jazzed about the rise of the jamstack, and edge computing.
