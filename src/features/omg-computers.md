I'm a software engineer with 14 years of experience implementing large-scale web projects, primarily working with open-source CMS platforms. I like developing tools that help teams deploy and maintain the things they build. I'm pretty jazzed about the rise of the jamstack, and edge computing. I work at <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>.
